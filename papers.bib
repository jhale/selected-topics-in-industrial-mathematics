We will show how the PUFEM can be used to employ the structure of the differential equation under consideration to construct effective and robust methods. Although the method and its theory are valid in n dimensions, a detailed and illustrative analysis will be given for a one-dimensional model problem. We identify some classes of non-standard problems which can profit highly from the advantages of the PUFEM and conclude this paper with some open questions concerning implementational aspects of the PUFEM.},

An algorithm is also presented for computing the three term recurrence relation from the moments of the weight function.},
