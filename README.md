# Selected Topics in Industrial Mathematics
## Winter Semester 2021/2022, Masters in Industrial Mathematics

In this seminar series we will discover some classic papers that have had
a huge impact on the field of Industrial Mathematics. As well as understanding
the technical content of the papers, you will be encouraged to form a broader
