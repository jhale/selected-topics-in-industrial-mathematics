# Selected Topics in Industrial Mathematics
## Winter Semester 2021/2022, Masters in Industrial Mathematics
### Jack S. Hale, University of Luxembourg

In this seminar series we will discover together a range of classic papers that
have had a huge impact on the fields of industrial mathematics. The vision of
the course is to help students form a broader view of the history of the field,
understand the context of some of these important developments, and see how
those advances have influenced modern industrial practice.
