Office hours: 1000-1100 Wednesdays, drop-in.

#### Dates

### Description

In this seminar series we will discover some classic papers that have had a
huge impact on the field of Industrial Mathematics. As well as understanding
the technical content of the papers, you will be encouraged to form a broader
view of the history of the field, to understand the context of these important
developments, and to see how those advances have influenced modern industrial
practice. The course and its content will be student-led following the
framework outlined below.

### Assessment (draft)

Due to the collaborative nature of the course, attendance is mandatory. Excuses
must be made via email in advance of the session.

Students will be assessed on the following pieces of coursework. There is no
examination.

The deadline for the report and code is 8th December 2023 at 1700. The report
should be submitted as a PDF and GitHub link via email.

Further organisational details about the presentation will be given nearer the time.

1. A written report of approximately ten A4 pages that touches equally on the
   five roles detailed below. The report should be prepared using LaTeX.

2. Supporting code examples should be uploaded to a GitHub repository and 
   linked to in the report.

3. A presentation of 25 minutes plus a question and answer session that covers
   the main points made in the report.

### Outline

Assuming enough time, each student should be able to pick one paper. All students
will be expected to read each paper. For each paper, some students will be
assigned roles with specific deeper responsibilities.

The students will be divided into five groups with different responsibilities:

* [The Historians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/historians.md %}). Understand
  the historical context of the paper; prior works, the authors biography, or
  the general technological/political/cultural context of the time.
* [The Technicians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/technicians.md %}). Will be
  responsible for reading the paper with care and producing a summary
  presentation and report of the main results.
* [The Experimentalists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/experimentalists.md %}).
  If appropriate, will re-produce some of the results from the paper in a
  simple dynamic programming language, e.g. Python or MATLAB.
* [The Futurists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/futurists.md %}). Understand
  the impact of the paper in future academic research and in an industrial
  context. Discover how the presentation of the key ideas of the paper has
  evolved in e.g. modern textbooks.
* [Critics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/critics.md %}). Will ‘critique’ the
  article in a constructive way, e.g. What was clear? What was not clear? Is
  the information laid out in a good order?  Are there any omissions?  Are the
  arguments strong? What could be improved?

### Papers

Suggestions from the students are of course welcome!
