# Selected Topics in Industrial Mathematics
## Winter Semester 2021/2022, Masters in Industrial Mathematics

### Practicalities

Instructor: Jack S. Hale (jack.hale@uni.lu). Office hours: 1500-1600 Wednesdays.

Weekly starting Wednesday 22nd September 2022 until 22nd December inclusive.
Belval Campus Maison du Nombre 1.020, 1130 to 1300.

### Description

In this seminar series we will discover some classic papers that have had
a huge impact on the field of Industrial Mathematics. As well as understanding
the technical content of the papers, you will be encouraged to form a broader
view of the history of the field, to understand the context of these important
developments, and to see how those advances have influenced modern industrial
practice. The course and its content will be student-led following the
framework outlined below.

### Assessment

Students will be graded with a reasonable passing grade given satisfactory
participation and engagement in the class. Students who are not contributing
will be given feedback in private during the course so that they can make
efforts to improve. Those that make an effort beyond the norm will receive
higher grades.

The range of roles mean that there should be something to suit everyone's
natural strengths.

### Outline

Assuming enough time, each student should be able to pick one paper. All students
will be expected to read each paper. For each paper, some students will be
assigned roles with specific deeper responsibilities.

The students will be divided into five groups with different responsibilities:

* [The Historians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/historians.md }). Understand
  the historical context of the paper; prior works, the authors biography, or
  the general technological/political/cultural context of the time.
* [The Technicians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/technicians.md }). Will be
  responsible for reading the paper with care and producing a summary
  presentation and report of the main results.
* [The Experimentalists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/experimentalists.md
  }). If appropriate, will re-produce some of the results from the paper in a
  simple dynamic programming language, e.g. Python or MATLAB.
* [The Futurists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/futurists.md }). Understand
  the impact of the paper in future academic research and in an industrial
  context. Discover how the presentation of the key ideas of the paper has
  evolved in e.g. modern textbooks.
* [Critics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/critics.md %}). Will ‘critique’ the
  article in a constructive way, e.g. What was clear? What was not clear? Is
  the information laid out in a good order?  Are there any omissions?  Are the
  arguments strong? What could be improved?

Each group is expected to produce a written handout on their findings to
distribute in the class. The handout can be in note form.

### Papers

Suggestions from the students are of course welcome!
